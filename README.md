# Harkirat Cohort 2.0 Assignment Solutions 🚀

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository of assignment solutions for the **Harkirat Cohort 2.0 MERN Stack** course. This course has been a transformative journey, equipping me with the skills and knowledge to build full-stack applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js and a lot.

## My Approach
In tackling these assignments, I've employed best practices and efficient coding standards to ensure that my solutions are not only functional but also optimized. I've commented my code extensively to provide clarity on my logic and decision-making process.


## Learnings 📘
Throughout this course, I've learned a tremendous amount, not just about coding, but also about problem-solving and thinking like a developer. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Persistence**: Facing bugs and errors is a part of the development process. Persistence in debugging and problem-solving is crucial.
- **Best Practices**: Writing clean, readable, and well-documented code makes maintenance and collaboration much easier.
- **State Management**: Understanding state management in React has been pivotal for creating dynamic user interfaces.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Gaining a holistic view of how the front-end and back-end work together has been enlightening.
